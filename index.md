These are just notes to myself about deep learning. I'm currently taking the fast.ai part 1 course. I have essentially no background in math or comp sci. If you have somehow unwittingly found your way to this blog, and for someone irrational reason choose to keep reading, please feel free to drop me a line with any comments, suggestions, notes about errors, notes about flaws in my thinking, and so forth. So far, I am planning on developing the following sections:

1. Things to remember.
2. Things I need to find out more about because I'm interested in them. 
3. Things to find out more about because I'm a little fuzzy on them, i.e. I don't have a clue about what's going on. 
4. Thoughts on papers. 

I look forward to hearing from anyone. But go easy on me ;-). jk. I'm a glutton for punishment.
